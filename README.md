# Git Submodule Test
This is a test repo for learning how git submodules work. The other repos in this project are:

- [sm-primary](https://github.com/singhmansingh/sm-primary) - First frontend built with plain HTML and jquery
- [sm-secondary](https://github.com/singhmansingh/sm-secondary) - Second frontend build with plain HTML and tailwind
- [sm-data](https://github.com/singhmansingh/sm-data) - data repo of 10 fun facts from [https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/](https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl/) 

## Secondary
This repo is the second of the main modules. It is a simple site built with tailwindCSS to style the data. The submodule will be located in the `/data` folder once imported.
